## Context

Padayon-Fi is a next-generation smart WiFi vending machine designed to go far beyond providing basic internet access. It is a self-service, all-in-one digital kiosk that integrates flexible payment methods, automated advertising, and centralized management into a single platform. The system is intended to modernize the traditional vendo business in the Philippines by offering multiple revenue streams and community-focused digital services.
